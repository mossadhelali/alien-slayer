# Alien Slayer

I developed this space shooter game back in 2014 as a project for my introduction to programming course (ICS201 @ KFUPM). Still proud of this little game :)

This is the game descrition I wrote back then:

> Alien Slayer is a game where the player takes the role of a space ship Playing to kill the incoming Alien ships. The player will face the danger of being killed by two types of alien ships: Shooters that try to kill the player by shooting bullets and Followers that try to kill the player by colliding with the player ship. In order to kill the aliens, the player shoots bullets on them by controlling the mouse and avoids collision with them by moving with WASD keyboard controls.

# Running the Project
* Add the project to the [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipseide.org/)
* Run  [AlienSlayer.java](src/AlienSlayer.java)

# How to Play
* Use the W-A-S-D keys to move the space ship.
* Point with the mouse and press left click to fire bullets.

# Thanks
I am thankful to Dr. Lahouari Ghouti and Dr. Moayad Alnammi for this learning experience. Great teachers can change lives, indeed!
